The display mentioned is also a 14.5\" OLED but is a non-touch version in one of the options, which may not meet the user's expectations for touch functionality. Furthermore, the user explicitly asked for a 1 TB SSD, but the lowest configuration presented only includes a 512 GB SSD. Overall, this recommended product does not adequately fulfill the specific requirements provided by the user.\n"
